- üè∑Ô∏è Preserve artifact titles, types, and language information
- üìÇ Organize artifacts into directories based on type

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download it as a ZIP file
2. Extract the contents to a folder
3. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
4. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top-right corner)
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder
6. The extension should now be installed and ready to use

## Usage

1. Navigate to a Claude conversation at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/)

- The organization preference affects both file structure and README detail level

## Technical Details

### API Approach

This extension interacts with the Claude API to extract artifacts, providing several advantages:

1. **Reliability**: Does not depend on Claude's UI structure, making it more resistant to website changes
2. **Completeness**: Extracts all artifacts with their full metadata
3. **Error Handling**: Better error detection and reporting for API failures

### API Endpoints Used

- Organization ID: `https://claude.ai/api/organizations`
- Conversation data: `https://claude.ai/api/organizations/{orgId}/chat_conversations/{conversationId}`

### Architecture

- **manifest.json**: Contains extension configuration and permissions
- **popup/**: Contains the user interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **content.js**: Handles communication with the Claude API
- **background.js**: Manages extension state and initialization

### Error Handling

- API failures are detected and reported with specific error messages
- Network errors are caught and displayed to the user
- Fallback mechanisms for downloading when Chrome's download API is unavailable

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Chrome/Chromium-based browser
